Project Title: Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and other relevant factors. The model aims to provide users with an estimated price of a car based on their inputs, enabling better decision-making for buyers and sellers in the automotive market.

Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language for developing the model and application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Streamlit: For building the web application.
Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model and preprocessing objects.

Below is a detailed explanation of the project requirements, resources needed, and the theoretical framework underpinning your car price prediction project, incorporating the code context we've previously discussed.

Project Requirements
Technical Requirements:

Python 3.x: The primary programming language used for development.
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and tools.
Joblib: For saving and loading models and preprocessing objects.
Streamlit: For creating a web application interface.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization (if used in exploratory data analysis).
System Requirements:

Operating System: Windows/Linux/MacOS (the code should run on any of these platforms as long as the required libraries are installed).
RAM: At least 8 GB is recommended for handling data processing and model training efficiently.
Storage: Sufficient disk space to store the datasets, trained models, and application files.
Data Requirements:

Datasets: Cleaned car dataset (car_dekho_cleaned_dataset.csv) that includes relevant features for price prediction (e.g., manufacturer, model, year, mileage, etc.).
Preprocessed Data: Objects for label encoding and scaling (stored in label_encoders.pkl and scalers.pkl) for handling categorical and numerical features.
Resources
Datasets:

The main dataset used for model training and evaluation. This should be in a clean and well-structured format, ideally in CSV format.
Model Files:

Trained machine learning model (car_price_prediction_model.pkl) which contains the Random Forest model that has been optimized through hyperparameter tuning.
Documentation:

A README file detailing how to set up and run the project, including information on required dependencies and how to use the Streamlit application.
Code Structure:

Clear organization of code files into directories such as data, models, src, and notebooks.
Development Environment:

Recommended to use an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook for developing the application and conducting exploratory data analysis.
Working Theory
Overview: The theory behind this project is rooted in machine learning and predictive analytics. The primary focus is on using regression algorithms to predict car prices based on various features that represent the attributes of a car.

Machine Learning Fundamentals:

Supervised Learning: The model is trained using labeled data, where the features (input variables) correspond to car characteristics and the target variable is the car price.
Regression Analysis: As this project involves predicting a continuous variable (price), regression algorithms are employed. Random Forest Regression is utilized due to its robustness against overfitting and ability to handle high-dimensional datasets.
Data Preprocessing:

The input data requires preprocessing steps:
Handling Categorical Variables: Encoding categorical features such as manufacturer and model using label encoders.
Normalization: Scaling numerical features to a standard range, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.
Feature Engineering: Creating additional features (like car age and brand popularity) to enhance model performance.
Model Training:

The Random Forest model is trained using a subset of the data (training set) and optimized using techniques such as RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters. The model is then validated on a separate test set to evaluate its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score.
Model Evaluation:

Model performance is assessed based on its ability to generalize to unseen data. Cross-validation is employed to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the training data.
Web Application Interface:

Streamlit is used to create an interactive web application that allows users to input car features and receive price predictions. The application integrates preprocessing steps and model predictions seamlessly.
